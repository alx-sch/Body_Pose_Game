# STRIKE A POSE! 
**Predictive Body Pose Classification via Sequential Neural Network Analysis in a Dynamic Videogame**

## Intro 
"STRIKE A POSE!" is a videogame I developed in 1.5 weeks as my final project at [SPICED's](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en) Data Science Bootcamp.   

It's a fun workout challenge using body pose classification, in which to follow along with various exercises:   
From squats to standing, hiding, making an X, or striking a unique pose of your own, you'll work up a sweat! üèãÔ∏è   

You have the flexibility to adjust the number of rounds and the time between poses for an extra challenge.    

Data collection, model training, and the game script are modularized, making it easy to customize to meet your unique workout needs üí™
