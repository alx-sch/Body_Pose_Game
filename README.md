## Intro 
"STRIKE A POSE!" is a videogame I developed in 1.5 weeks as my final project at a Data Science Bootcamp.   

It's a fun workout challenge using body pose classification, in which to follow along with various exercises:   
From squats to standing, hiding, making an X, or striking a unique pose of your own, you'll work up a sweat! 🏋️   

You have the flexibility to adjust the number of rounds and the time between poses for an extra challenge.    

Data collection, model training, and the game script are modularized, making it easy to customize to meet your unique workout needs. 💪

### Installation

To get started with "STRIKE A POSE!", follow these steps:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alx-sch/STRIKE_A_POSE_Body_Pose_Classification_Game.git

2. Optional: Create and activate a virtual environment for better isolation of dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv envname # Create a virtual environment (macOS/LINUX)
    source envname/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment

    deactivate # Deactivate the virtual environment when not needed anymore

3. Install the game-specific requirements.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### How to Play
To enjoy "STRIKE A POSE!", follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Start the game by specifying the number of rounds and the time between poses. For example:

   ```bash
   python play.py 10 5  # Start with 10 rounds and 5 seconds between poses

3. A window with a video feed will appear. Adjust your position and camera angle to fit the green square.
   
4. Controls:
  - Press the 'Space' key to start the countdown.
  - You can press 'R' to restart the script execution or 'Q' to quit the game

### Make it Yours!
Adjust the game to your needs! 💪     
Please refer to the documentation in collect_data.py, train_model.ipynb, and play.py for details.
- Collect training data of poses of your choice with **collect_data.py**.
- Train a new model to detect these new poses and evaluate the model's performance using **train_model.ipynb**. You are encouraged to explore and experiment with different model architectures.
- Adjust the model used, poses, and respective sound files (see [Audio Credits](#audio-credits)) in **play.py** to start your new Pose Game!
